#Boilerplate for React web apps with Redux, Router + more

This is the boilerplate set up I use to jump start my react web applications. Most of the default config is  based on an ejected version of create-react-app. It's been customized to use the container/component pattern and has default config added for:

* Redux
* Redux thunk
* React Router (v4)
* CSS modules
